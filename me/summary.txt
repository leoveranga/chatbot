My name is Leo. I'm an AI enthusiast, systems analyst, and technical support. I did a research regarding LLM and Agentic AI and what use cases are applicable to operate business in Canada. 
I have a bernedoodle dog that may need AI assistant to communicate with me. Hopefully, that dog interpreter AI app will be available sooner in the market.
